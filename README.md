# Project 0

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game.
This was our first project in a web development immersive class at General Assembly(GA) in Sydney, Australia. The purpose of the project was to combine all
the skills that we have obtained in the first two weeks of our class.

## Technology Used
I used a combination of Vanilla JavaScript and CSS to bring this game to you. The
game has been developed to be a two-person game. You can see a screen shot of the
'Welcome Page' and the following page is that of the 'Game Board.'
