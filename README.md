# Project 0

## Tic-Tac-Toe Game.
This was our first project in a web development immersive class at General Assembly(GA) in Sydney, Australia. The purpose of the project was to combine all the skills that we have obtained in the first two weeks of our class.

## Technology Used
I used a combination of Vanilla JavaScript and CSS to bring this game to you. You can play the game at the following site: <a href="https://seando13.github.io/Project0/index.html" target="_blank">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> The game has been developed to be a two-person game. You are greeted with a welcome screen where you can enter the name of the two contestants playing each other. Then you alternate between X and O until there is a winner or a 'Cat's Game'.

## Build Status
Currently the game is in a playable state. However, I would like to add a reset button and a stretch goal of adding AI(Artificial Intelligence).
